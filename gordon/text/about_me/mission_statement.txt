As a Data Engineer it is my mission to empower decision 
making within the organization I serve by building 
Reliable, Scalable, Secure and Cost Effective Data Systems.

I accomplish this by first studying and building a thorough 
understanding of the pros and cons of the current infrastructure.
I then create a strategic plan to iteratively optimize this 
infrastructure with as little downtime as possible.

For the implementation, I use industry proven technologies 
such as Python, SQL, Airflow, and Docker, as well as an arsenal
of innovative cloud technologies such as AWS S3 etc.
