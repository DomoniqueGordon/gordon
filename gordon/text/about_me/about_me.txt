I am a growth minded engineer who stays up to date with industry 
best practices by routinely taking online courses, pursuing certificates, 
reading books and articles, watching and listening to relevant videos 
and podcast and more.

I strive to empower aspiring Data Engineers by mentoring in my spare time. 
I believe it is important for us to teach as we learn and to help others 
grow as we continue to grow.

I'm absolutely passionate about my craft and it is my desire to use this 
passion to help drive the growth of any organization with an amazing culture 
and a meaningful, and captivating mission.
