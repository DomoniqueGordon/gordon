Dom's work on the Netsuite Pipeline Rearchitecture has, if anything, been undersold in his self-evaluation. 
This was incredible work on his part. He went into some detail in his self-evaluation, 
but the technical challenges of understanding this process flow were enormous. 

The Netsuite pipeline is by far the most challenging architecture that we have in Data Engineering, 
and Dom came in and rapidly understood the existing system and how to make it better.

More importantly, Dom used this project to create a strong and lasting relationship with Kelly, 
the person who created the original architecture. Taking over someone else's project and re-architecting 
it takes not only technical skills, but political ones as well, and Dom excelled at making this relationship work. 
In addition, he gained the trust of the people on the Finance team, so that any concerns they might have had about 
someone else taking over this project were quickly dispelled.

Also, I want to highlight the work Dom did with Hevo. 
Not only did he investigate all of the possible solutions, doing an incredible amount of research work, 
he implemented the solution all on his own, saving Curology over $1000/month with this solution. And when 
the transition from FlyData was going to require weekend work in order to not have downtime for our customers, 
he volunteered to do it without any complaint at all, in fact an eagerness to take on this responsibility. 

That willingness to take on the large challenges is one of the most remarkable things about Dom.
