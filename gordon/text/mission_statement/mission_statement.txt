"""
As a Data Engineer it is my mission to empower decision making within the organization I serve 
by building Reliable, Scalable,  Secure and Cost Effective Data Systems.

I accomplish this by first building a thorough understanding of the current infrastructure in place.
I then create a strategic plan to iteratively optimize and expand on this infrastructure with as little downtime as possible.

I then execute on this plan by the applying my expertise with industry recognized technologies such as Python, SQL, Airflow, and Docker. 
As well as an arsenal of innovative cloud technologies.

I am a growth minded engineer who stays up to date with industry best practices by routinely taking online courses, 
pursuing certificates, reading books and articles, watching and listening to relevant videos and podcas
and more.

I empower aspiring Data Engineers by through my mentoring so that they can learn as I learn and develop the skills that are most conducive to
accoplishing their goals.

I absolutely love my work and it is always my pleasure to contribute to the growth of organizations with amazing cultures and captivating missions 
for the betterment of our society.
