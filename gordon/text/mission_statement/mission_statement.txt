"""
As a Data Engineer it is my mission to empower decision making within the organization I serve 
by building Reliable, Scalable, Secure and Cost Effective Data Systems.

I accomplish this by first studying and building a thorough understanding of the pros and cons of the current infrastructure.
I then create a strategic plan to iteratively optimize this infrastructure with as little downtime as possible.

For the implementation, I use industry recognized technologies such as Python, SQL, Airflow, and Docker,
as well as an arsenal of innovative cloud technologies such as AWS S3 etc.

I am a growth minded engineer who stays up to date with industry best practices by routinely taking online courses, 
pursuing certificates, reading books and articles, watching and listening to relevant videos and podcas
and more.

I aim empower aspiring Data Engineers through my mentoring so that they can grow as I grow and develop strong technical 
skills that are conducive to success.

I absolutely love my work and love to contribute to the growth of organizations with amazing cultures 
and captivating missions for the betterment of our society.
